# Creative iMedia Statement
- These are some projects that I did whilst I was at secondary school.
- I did a range of things including creating a mini comic, website, and a game cover for a magazine.
- I prepared for all these by following the Learning Objectives. This included working with: client briefs (outlining my objectives),
mood boards (placing my ideas and images associated with the topic), visualisation diagrams (rough sketch of final product),
Gantt Charts (Excel graph on managing my time whilst I complete the project as I had a deadline to complete these; see links below for more info),
evidences and screenshots of my work and how I put it all together. 
- I had to follow strict instructions from the client (listed in Client Briefs) but with some freedom for my own preferences. 
- R082, R084, and R087 are just the project names... the LO's are the Learning Objectives.
- See these links for more guidance on the projects and what exactly I had to do:
